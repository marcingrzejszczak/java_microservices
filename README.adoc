= Java Microservices Workshop

Requirements:

- JDK 17
- Docker
- Vault CLI
- KIND - Kubernetes in Docker

== How to prepare

You can call the script that fetches docker images and downloads all application JARs.

```
$ ./scripts/download_everything.sh
```

Go to https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install to learn how to install Vault CLI. Then you can make this call

```
$ vault --version
```

Go to https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start to learn how to install KIND. If you install it then you can run this command to create a cluster

```
$ kind create cluster
```

=== Manual preparation

In the sections below you can find hints on how to manually prepare your environment.

==== Docker Images

If you're using Windows and can't run this script then ensure that you pull the Docker images for these docker compose files (`$ docker compose pull`)

- `./docker-compose.yml`
- `./week3/part1/docker-compose.yml`
